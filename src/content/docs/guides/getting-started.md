## What Are AI Coding Agents?

AI coding agents are tools that can autonomously write, edit, test, and debug code. Unlike simple autocomplete, agents can:

- Plan multi-step implementations
- Edit multiple files at once
- Run tests and fix failures
- Create git commits and pull requests

## Quick Start: Pick Your Path

### 🖥️ Want an AI-powered IDE?
→ Try [**Cursor**](/agents/cursor/) — VS Code with AI built in

### ⌨️ Prefer the terminal?
→ Try [**Claude Code**](/agents/claude-code/) — Powerful terminal agent

### 🐙 Already deep in GitHub?
→ Try [**GitHub Copilot**](/agents/github-copilot/) — Native GitHub integration

### ☁️ Want cloud-based automation?
→ Try [**OpenAI Codex**](/agents/openai-codex/) — Parallel cloud tasks

### 🔧 Want something customizable?
→ Try [**AdaL CLI**](/agents/adal/) — Self-evolving, open-source powered

## Step 1: Set Up Your Agent

1. **Install the tool** (npm, brew, download)
2. **Authenticate** (API key or subscription)
3. **Open your project**
4. **Create a config file** (AGENTS.md)

## Step 2: Write Your AGENTS.md

The single most impactful thing you can do:

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

## Build & Test
- Install: `npm install`
- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Test: `npm test`

## Code Style
- TypeScript, strict mode
- Functional React components
```

See the full [AGENTS.md guide →](/formats/agents-md/)

## Step 3: Start Coding

Give your agent a task:

> "Add a dark mode toggle to the header component."

The agent will read your codebase, plan, implement, and optionally test.
