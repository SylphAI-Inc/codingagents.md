## Overview

The OpenAI Agents SDK is OpenAI's official framework for building AI agents. It provides a minimal, opinionated API for creating agents with tool calling, handoffs between agents, and guardrails — all using native OpenAI models.

## Key Features

- **Agent primitives** — Agents, tools, handoffs, guardrails
- **Native OpenAI integration** — First-class support for GPT-4o, o1, Codex
- **Tracing** — Built-in execution tracing for debugging
- **Handoffs** — Agent-to-agent delegation
- **Guardrails** — Input/output validation

## When to Use

✅ Building on OpenAI models exclusively
✅ Want minimal framework overhead
✅ Simple agent-to-agent handoff patterns
✅ Need OpenAI-native tracing

❌ Multi-provider model support needed
❌ Complex graph-based workflows
