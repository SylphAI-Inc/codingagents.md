## Overview

CrewAI models multi-agent systems as teams with roles. You define agents with specific roles (researcher, coder, reviewer), assign them tasks, and CrewAI orchestrates their collaboration — like managing a human team.

## Key Features

- **Role-based agents** — Define agents by role, goal, and backstory
- **Task delegation** — Agents can delegate work to each other
- **Sequential & parallel** — Tasks run in sequence or parallel
- **Tool integration** — Built-in and custom tools
- **Memory** — Short-term, long-term, and entity memory

## When to Use

✅ Multi-agent workflows with clear role separation
✅ Want intuitive "team" mental model
✅ Building enterprise automation pipelines

❌ Need fine-grained graph control (use LangGraph)
❌ Single-agent use cases
