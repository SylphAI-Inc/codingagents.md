## What It Does

Google Antigravity is an agent-first IDE that combines a traditional coding experience with autonomous AI agents. It features two primary views: an Editor View (standard IDE with AI sidebar) and a Manager View (control center for orchestrating multiple agents working in parallel across workspaces).

## Key Strengths

- **Agent-first architecture**: Spawn and manage multiple autonomous agents working in parallel
- **Multi-model**: Supports Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and GPT-OSS models
- **Manager View**: Orchestrate asynchronous agent workflows across workspaces
- **MCP support**: Connect external tools and data sources including Google Cloud services
- **Artifacts**: Agents produce verifiable deliverables like screenshots and browser recordings
- **Browser integration**: Agents can autonomously interact with browser and terminal
- **Free tier**: Generous free usage with Gemini 3 Pro during public preview

## Pricing
